# porfolio-mean
## Matt Valli's portfolio developed with MEAN using AngularJS 1.6.x

Good projects start with a solid foundation and well defined structure, practices and conventions.

I chose to use Yeoman, Gulp, and Bower to assist me through the development process using the following Yeoman Generator:

[Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.2.2.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node >= 4.x.x, npm >= 2.x.x
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development

Run `gulp build` for building and `gulp serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `npm test` will run the unit tests with karma.
